# High Sensitivity Configuration
# Detects more chimeras but may have more false positives

detection:
  coverage_fold_change: 1.4        # Lower threshold = more sensitive
  gc_content_threshold: 0.07       # More sensitive to GC changes
  kmer_distance_threshold: 0.21    # More sensitive to k-mer differences
  confidence_threshold: 0.4        # Lower confidence threshold

behavior:
  sensitivity: "high"              # High sensitivity mode
  split_technical: true
  split_pcr: true
  preserve_biological: true        # Still preserve biological events

output:
  log_level: "DEBUG"              # More verbose logging for analysis
