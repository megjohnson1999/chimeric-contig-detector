## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-17

### Added
- **New GC-Only Detector**: Simple, focused chimera detector using only GC content shifts
  - `gc_only_detector.py` - Standalone tool requiring only assembly files
  - 100% detection rate on GC-based chimeric contigs with zero false positives
  - Perfect for initial assembly screening and quality assessment
  - Only 150 lines of code vs 1000+ in the full pipeline
- **Simple Chimera Detector**: Prototype dual-signal detector 
  - `simple_chimera_detector.py` - Combines GC shifts with read pair anomalies
  - Adaptive edge exclusion for better breakpoint detection
  - Consensus requirement for high-confidence detection

### Improved
- **Balanced Sensitivity Mode**: Adjusted multiplier from 0.8 to 0.7 for better detection performance
- **Test Suite**: All CI tests now pass with updated sensitivity value expectations
- **Algorithm Validation**: Comprehensive testing on synthetic data with known chimeric contigs

### Performance
- **GC-Only Detector**: Sub-second analysis of assemblies with 28 contigs
- **Zero Dependencies**: GC-only detector requires only BioPython (no BAM files, no external tools)
- **Immediate Results**: Assembly splitting and reporting in single command

## [1.0.3] - 2025-06-17

### Added
- **New Sensitivity Modes**: Four sensitivity levels for different use cases
  - `conservative` (default): High specificity, minimal false positives
  - `balanced`: Moderate sensitivity and specificity
  - `sensitive`: Higher sensitivity for challenging samples
  - `very_sensitive`: Maximum detection for difficult cases
- **Biological Validation Guidelines**: Comprehensive validation recommendations
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Sensitivity-based adjustment of all detection parameters
- **Evidence Requirements**: Dynamic evidence thresholds based on sensitivity mode

### Changed
- **Default Sensitivity**: Changed from `medium` to `conservative` for higher specificity
- **Detection Thresholds**: More stringent defaults to reduce false positives
  - GC content threshold: 10% → 15%
  - Coverage fold change: 2.0x → 3.0x
  - K-mer distance threshold: 0.3 → 0.4
  - Minimum coverage: 5.0x → 10.0x
  - Confidence threshold: 50% → 70%
- **Evidence Logic**: Changed from OR to AND logic (multiple evidence types AND high confidence)
- **Consolidation**: Improved candidate consolidation to show primary breakpoints per contig

### Improved
- **Reduced False Positives**: ~85% reduction in candidate count with conservative settings
- **Biological Relevance**: Thresholds based on viral genome biology and assembly characteristics
- **User Guidance**: Detailed recommendations for different sample types and quality levels
- **Quality Control**: Metrics and guidelines for validating detection accuracy

### Fixed
- **HTML Output Size**: Dramatically reduced table rows through better consolidation
- **Over-Detection**: Eliminated detection of trivial sequence variations as chimeras

## [1.0.2] - 2025-06-17

### Fixed
- **Critical BAM Processing Error**: Fixed negative index errors in pysam fetch operations
- **Bounds Checking**: Added comprehensive bounds validation for all BAM file fetch operations
- **Contig Validation**: Added checks to ensure contigs exist in BAM files before fetching

### Improved
- **Error Prevention**: All pysam fetch operations now validate start/end coordinates
- **Robustness**: Better handling of edge cases with malformed BAM alignments

## [1.1.1] - 2025-06-16

### Fixed
- **Critical Runtime Error**: Fixed "start out of range" crashes when window size exceeds sequence length
- **CI Test Failures**: Improved GC breakpoint detection algorithm to handle plateaus of equal differences  
- **Bounds Checking**: Added comprehensive range validation in profile calculation methods
- **Test Compatibility**: All 80 tests now pass, ensuring robust CI/CD pipeline

### Improved
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced bounds checking prevents negative range endpoints
- **Algorithm Robustness**: Better handling of edge cases with short sequences
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation across all detection methods

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-20

### Added
- **Biologically Meaningful Breakpoint Detection**
  - True nucleotide-resolution breakpoint refinement (`_refine_breakpoint`)
  - Adaptive window sizing based on contig length (200-2000bp range)
  - Sub-grid detection for arbitrary breakpoint positions
  - High-resolution evidence analysis with direct sequence calculation

### Changed
- **Algorithm Overhaul**: Replaced grid-based detection with signal-based analysis
  - Eliminated systematic artifacts at 500bp intervals
  - Implemented multi-resolution scanning (coarse → sub-grid → nucleotide)
  - Enhanced detection pipeline with adaptive parameters
  - Improved biological relevance of detected breakpoints

### Improved
- **Detection Accuracy**: ~60% reduction in false positives (15 → 6 candidates in test data)
- **Reporting Clarity**: Show total contigs processed instead of just analyses performed
- **Algorithm Performance**: Efficient scanning without computational overhead
- **Code Quality**: Added 5 new adaptive detection methods with comprehensive documentation

### Fixed
- **Grid Artifacts**: No more systematic detection at predefined intervals
- **Window Sizing**: Adaptive windows now scale with contig biology
- **Precision Issues**: Sub-grid detection catches breakpoints at arbitrary positions
