# Changelog

All notable changes to Chimeric Detective will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-20

### Added
- **Biologically Meaningful Breakpoint Detection**
  - True nucleotide-resolution breakpoint refinement (`_refine_breakpoint`)
  - Adaptive window sizing based on contig length (200-2000bp range)
  - Sub-grid detection for arbitrary breakpoint positions
  - High-resolution evidence analysis with direct sequence calculation

### Changed
- **Algorithm Overhaul**: Replaced grid-based detection with signal-based analysis
  - Eliminated systematic artifacts at 500bp intervals
  - Implemented multi-resolution scanning (coarse → sub-grid → nucleotide)
  - Enhanced detection pipeline with adaptive parameters
  - Improved biological relevance of detected breakpoints

### Improved
- **Detection Accuracy**: ~60% reduction in false positives (15 → 6 candidates in test data)
- **Reporting Clarity**: Show total contigs processed instead of just analyses performed
- **Algorithm Performance**: Efficient scanning without computational overhead
- **Code Quality**: Added 5 new adaptive detection methods with comprehensive documentation

### Fixed
- **Grid Artifacts**: No more systematic detection at predefined intervals
- **Window Sizing**: Adaptive windows now scale with contig biology
- **Precision Issues**: Sub-grid detection catches breakpoints at arbitrary positions
- **Misleading Statistics**: Reporting now clearly distinguishes total vs analyzed contigs
